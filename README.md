The Golden Mile
===============

A level-up dungeon for learning to make basic web apps.

## The Quest ##
Make a product using each of the following APIs and host them on Github. The product should:

* Be device agnostic (work on all web-enabled devices)
* Use progressive enhancement (works with pure HTML, enhanced with further CSS/JS, etc.)
* The app should solve a real-life problem (simple is good!)
* The app should perform CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Use a map - have a site plan and a style guide. (This helps maintain a plan, prioritize app goals and usability, and define the project scope so that it doesn't get out of hand.)

### Front End ###
Build the front-end mockup for the app, enhancing it further with each step:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Media Queries
4. jQuery
5. AJAX
6. JSON

### Back End ###
Build six copies of the same application with CRUD functionality:

1. PHP + MYSQL
2. Rails RB
3. Django PY
4. Ember JS
5. Meteor JS
6. MEAN JS (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node)
