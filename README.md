The Golden Mile
===============

A level-up dungeon for learning to make basic web apps.

## The Quest ##
Make a product using each of the following APIs and host them on Github. The product should:

* Be device agnostic (work on all web-enabled devices)
* Use progressive enhancement (works with pure HTML, enhanced with further CSS/JS, etc.)
* The app should solve a real-life problem (simple is good!)
* The app should perform CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Use a map - have a site plan and a style guide (This helps maintain a plan, prioritize app goals and usability, and define the project scope so that it doesn't get out of hand.)

### Front End ###
Build the front-end mockup for the app, enhancing it further with each step:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Media Queries
4. jQuery
5. AJAX
6. JSON

### Back End ###
Build six copies of the same application with six different back-end frameworks, for example:

1. PHP + MYSQL
2. Rails RB
3. Django PY
4. Ember JS
5. Meteor JS
6. MEAN JS (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node)


## The Map ##
Take some time to prepare for your app before you start coding:

### Site Plan ###
You can document your plan however you like, but make sure it answers the following questions:

* What is the purpose/mission statement of this site?
* What is the specific goal of the site?
* Who are the typical users of the site?
* What are some of the interactive behaviors the site will need... what can users do?
* What kind of content is needed? What do you have already?

### Style Guide ###
This is a guide for you and anyone on your team - it can be a screenshot, some sketches, a document, or all of the above. Typically a style guide will address:

* Colors
* Typography
* Media (Images, thumbnails, etc)
* Common Display Elements (Buttons, lists, navigation, etc.)


## The Journey ##
Use tools to provide a smooth, modern workflow as you build. As of this writing, here are some good examples:

* [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) - A social playground for front-end web development. Great for creative play: skip the setup and jump right in!
* [Github](https://github.com/) - A social development environment for housing projects. Keep your code in Github Repositories for storage, versioning, and easy collaboration.
* [Emmet (Zen Coding](http://docs.emmet.io/) - A plugin for quick and easy coding with HTML. No more typing angle-brackets. If you're using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for your text editor, this can be easily installed using the [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/).
* [Web Developer Browser Plug-In](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) - Easily disable CSS/Javascript, look for alt tags, validate your html/css, select colors, and more with this browser plugin.
