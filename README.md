The Golden Mile
===============

An epic level-up journey for learning to make web apps.

## The Quest ##
> "It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to."

> -- Bilbo Baggins


That's right, ladies and gents: We're going to Mordor. We're daring to take on 12 weeks web-dev sprinting craziness, preparing to take a few hits along the way. After all... one does not simply walk into Mordor.

The Goal: Make a product using each of the following APIs and host them on Github. 

The product should:

* Be device agnostic (work on all web-enabled devices)
* Use progressive enhancement (works with pure HTML, enhanced with further CSS/JS, etc.)
* The app should solve a real-life problem (simple is good!)
* The app should perform CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
* Use a map - have a site plan and a style guide (This helps maintain a plan, prioritize app goals and usability, and define the project scope so that it doesn't get out of hand.)

### Front End ###
Build the front-end mockup for the app, enhancing it further with each step:

1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Media Queries
4. jQuery
5. AJAX
6. JSON

### Back End ###
Build six copies of the same application with six different back-end frameworks, for example:

1. PHP + MYSQL
2. Rails RB
3. Django PY
4. Ember JS
5. Meteor JS
6. MEAN JS (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node)


## The Map ##
> "The world is not in your books and maps. It's out there."

> -- Gandalf

There are a lot of aspects about the Golden Mile that you won't be able to plan ahead of time. You're venturing out into new territory, so leave some room for serendipity!

However, it always helps to have something of a plan. You don't want to be worried about colors while struggling with PHP errors. For that reason, consider creating a simple Site Plan and Style Guide. Start simple, with simple notes and sketches on a scratchpad.

### Site Plan ###
You can document your plan however you like, but make sure it answers the following questions:

* What is the purpose/mission statement of this site?
* What is the specific goal of the site?
* Who are the typical users of the site?
* What are some of the interactive behaviors the site will need... what can users do?
* What kind of content is needed? What do you have already?

### Style Guide ###
This is a guide for you and anyone on your team - it can be a screenshot, some sketches, a document, or all of the above. Typically a style guide will address:

* Colors
* Typography
* Layout/Grid/Wireframes
* Media (Images, thumbnails, etc)
* Common Display Elements (Buttons, lists, navigation, etc.)


## The Journey ##

> -- Samwise Gamgee

Be prepared - you don't want to get caught without rope, matches, or a pocket knife. Use tools to provide a smooth, modern workflow as you build. 

As of this writing, here are some good examples:

* [Codepen](http://codepen.io/) - A social playground for front-end web development. Great for creative play: skip the setup and jump right in!
* [Github](https://github.com/) - A social development environment for housing projects. Keep your code in Github Repositories for storage, versioning, and easy collaboration.
* [Emmet (Zen Coding](http://docs.emmet.io/) - A plugin for quick and easy coding with HTML. No more typing angle-brackets. If you're using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) for your text editor, this can be easily installed using the [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/).
* [Web Developer Browser Plug-In](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/) - Easily disable CSS/Javascript, look for alt tags, validate your html/css, select colors, and more with this browser plugin.


## The Record ##

> â€œI wonder if people will ever say, 'Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.'"

> -- Samwise Gamgee

Your epic journey needs to be recorded. Your story should be told. Keep a journal, a blog, a spreadsheet, or moleskin - whatever it is, record your progress as you go along.

This can be a spreadsheet record of time spent, a weekly blog, whatever feels comfortable to you. Whatever it is, keeping a record of your progress will help:

* Reflect on your learning - a quick mental review helps solidify what you've learned, which will definitely help you on future projects!
* Solve problems - something about writing down your predicament puts it into a more logical form. Instead of keeping it nebulously in your head, writing it down will put it in more certain terms - something your problem-solving mind can work with.
* Keep discouragement at bay. It's hard to trick yourself into thinking you haven't been making progress when your recorded proof says otherwise.
